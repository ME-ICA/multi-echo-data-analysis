# Notebooks README

This is a section to test out code and visualizations that will end up in the main Juypter book.
Nothing here will be accessible in the book,
but it will be easier for co-authors to test and share visualizations without need to re-render the html for each change.

Notebooks should have similar names to the markdown files they are testing visualizations for.
That is `./notebooks/fMRI_Sequences_pulse_sequence_visualizations.ipynb` would include figures that will migrate to `./content/fMRI_Sequences.md`
If the purpose of a notebook is not obvious by name,
use this readme to give context.
If figures are stable in the book,
then the related notebooks here should be deleted.
